# Dog Party
---
## Original Assignment:
[Dog Party](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/dog-party-2.0.html) project from Turing School of Software and Design

This was my first project with the goal of building a 1-page static site to practice writing well structured, semantic HTML with clean, precise CSS, as well as take a first crack at adding some user interaction with Javascript and the DOM.

## Reflections:
I really enjoyed the fine tune alterations that this project required.  As it was my first attempt using media queries, I did have some issues with layout staying in correct locations.  I chose to not display the top links once the screen reached a small enough resolution, as it seems like best practice would be to put these in a dropdown menu at that point.
